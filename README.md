# Ford GoBike System Data Visualization Project
## Overview
This project explores data from the Ford GoBike System, focusing on trips made during February 2019. The dataset includes various factors such as trip duration, start and end station information, user demographics (e.g., age, gender), and membership type.

## Dataset Overview
* Trips Data: Contains information about individual bike trips, including start and end times, station IDs, trip durations, and user details.
* Factors: Includes factors such as start station name, start station ID, start station longitude and latitude, end station ID, end station longitude and latitude, user type, member ID, user's birth year, gender, etc.

## Key Insights for Presentation
The project aims to summarize the findings of the data exploration through appropriate plots and visualizations. Key insights include:

1. Trips Duration vs. Number of Trips: Analysis of trip durations reveals a peak around 550 seconds, with the majority of trips lasting less than 2000 seconds. The distribution of trip durations is visualized using appropriate plots, with logarithmic scales applied for clarity.
2. Start and End Station Distribution: Visualization of start and end station IDs shows the stations with the largest number of trips starting and ending at them.
3. Trips Duration vs. Members Ages: Exploration of trip durations in relation to members' ages indicates that most members are aged between 20 and 45, with higher durations observed among younger members.
4. Trips Duration vs. Genders: Analysis of trip durations by gender reveals differences in trip duration distribution among males, females, and other genders. Higher percentages of females and others have longer trip durations compared to males.
5. Trips Duration vs. User Type: Comparison of trip durations between customer and subscriber types suggests that a higher percentage of customers take longer trips compared to subscribers.
